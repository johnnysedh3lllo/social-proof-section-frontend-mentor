## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
this challenge demanded an extensive use of CSS Grid which gave way to more understanding of the behaviour of CSS Grid in different layout settings.

### Continued development
in regard to my future plans for development, at this time i am still in the process of truly understanding how to make responsive layouts with CSS. all this time I've been most building components but from now i will be building more full page sites to really understand how to make responsive layouts in multiple cases.
